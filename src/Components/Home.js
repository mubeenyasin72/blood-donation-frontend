The family is usually the primary source of this help because it is the closest. The church and the community also play a role in ensuring the wellbeing of the needy people. All the three units have some specific parts that they are expected to play with the aim of helping the needy. The family may facilitate the course by first helping those closest to them like the elderly. An adult child can take the initiative to assist his or her old parents. Some situations, however, may lead to family members seeking help from elsewhere. This point is where the church and the community come in. The church may help by providing some essential services like feeding and a place to sleep. The community, on the other hand, may generate the resources necessary for this work. Therefore, everyone has a part to play in helping the needy.</p>
